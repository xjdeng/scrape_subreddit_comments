Just because someone older than 2 has a higher chance of being selected, doesn't mean that it's less likely for a two year old to get the one way mission than it is for a specific individual older than 2 to get the mission.\\nLet me give you an example. There are more numbers on a dice that are bigger than or equal to 2 (2,3,4,5,6) than there are are less than 2 (1). Therefore, given a uniform distribution, the probability that a given dice roll will result in a number bigger than or equal to 2 (5/6), is higher than it resulting in 1 (1/6).\\nHowever, this doesn't mean that it's less likely to get a 1 than it is to get a 3.. or a 5.. or a 6.. all possible outcomes are just as likely as eachother.. so no, a person older than 2 doesn't have a higher chance of being selected by the wizard (even though the probability that the wizard does selects a person over two is higher).. that's of course assuming that the wizard picks someone at random\\nEdit: Thought I'd give another example. Let's say you're analyzing lottery winners in a European country whose population is 95% white. What you'd expect to see is that about 95% of the winners are white. So it wouldn't be wrong to say that a lottery winner is more likely to be white (because of the ethnic distribution), but it wouldn't be right to say that as a white person you have a higher chance of winning the lottery than if you were black.

Find the dog.\\nWell, actually, you shouldn’t be at the party in the first place. If there is no dog, stand in a corner and pretend to urgently text someone.\\nNote: Sometimes the dog is under the table. Be careful not to bump your head.  \\n\\n5.If someone invites you to hang out, use the following formula to respond:\\n“Hey, I’m really sorry. [Insert excuse here]… Maybe another time?”\\nIf you need excuse ideas, you’ve got to get creative. There’s always the good old “I’m not feeling well,” but only use that once per friend group.\\nAnd just to be clear, the “maybe another time” part is a lie. Always use the formula.  \\n6.Keep your stream of consciousness in your head.\\nSure, what comes up must come down, but what goes in your brain does not need to immediately be regurgitated out. Remember, Quality \\n\\n\\nDon’t text anyone first.\\nPlus 20 points if you procrastinate responding to texts for so long that you forget about them. Plus another 20 if, two weeks later, when you suddenly see you forgot to respond, you still don’t say anything.  \\n\\n\\nAnd please, for the love of God, STOP BEING SO LOUD. \\nSee how those all caps felt like screaming? It was unpleasant, right? Yeah, well, so are you. Shhhhh.\\nBy following these 8 tips, you’re sure to successfully become an introvert.

Most people can power through the droll with ease where we can’t even tolerate it.\\nBut I contend that an INTP can absolutely thrive (perhaps in the upper 10th percentile) given the proper motivation / teleological foundation to offset our conscientiousness. It’s not that we hate work, it’s that we can’t do anything that feels like ‘busy work’. This became pretty obvious to me in school—English never felt like work and I aced essays especially if I could write about whatever I wanted. But give me a stack of math problems where the purpose is to ‘digest the material’ and I become a stubborn donkey about it. I already digested it the first few times, no need to add insult to injury.\\nThis is a bit controversial, but I think religion / spirituality can be an indispensable tool for the INTP for this same reason. By religion, I mean anything that is conductive to deep introspection and self discovery which can reveal some sort of intrinsic meaning to drive us.  We are not suited for nihilism, we’re bad at doing things ‘just because’. It also serves to downregulate the ‘T’ and boost the ‘IN-P’. Thinking tends to be a double-edged sword for us, a weapon we inflict damage on ourselves with. When we unlock the full capacity of our intuition, introspection, and perception, thinking takes its natural subservient role. No longer a servant to tyrannical thought, thinking becomes our loyal servant and our true skillset comes to the forefront, no longer shackled by the inner narrator.

Imagine 1+1=3. You and I know that 1+1=2, hopefully. So immediately (and perhaps confidently), you can call bullshit on something like \"1+1=3\". But it may not always have been that way. You may have had to learn addition first. Eventually, you became very confident that 1 plus 1 equals 2, and willing to stake your life on it in an argument. But it wasn\\'t always that way, which is important to remember. Somehow in life, through repetition and fluency, you gained confidence in many other areas.

It hit my ego really hard, but I finally realized I had to work harder than the average person there to be competitive.\\nIn college I realize that there are people far smarter than me, who have been working far harder than me all their life,  and are far more interested in the field I was intersted in. These people will - statistically speaking - likely achieve far greater things in life, and they probably deserve that, and I've learned to accept that.\\nNot everyone gets to be Elon Musk, Albert Einstein, Jeff Bezos.

Just one each.\\nSome things are true.

And it\\'s true, so I\\'m [smart|dumb] and that\\'s fine.\\nINTPs aren\\'t interested in their own intelligence, they\\'re interested in whether their ideas are sound or not.  We use whatever intellectual resources we have to expand our understanding so our ideas are more true/robust.  We spend a lot of time understanding things other people don\\'t care about without ever becoming real experts in those fields.  Call us dumb; it\\'s fine.  But when the shit hits the fan, we\\'re going to be able to explain exactly where the elephant\\'s anus is in relation to the air mover, and be able to lay out options to stop the fecal hurricane.
