Just because someone older than 2 has a higher chance of being selected, doesn't mean that it's less likely for a two year old to get the one way mission than it is for a specific individual older than 2 to get the mission.\\nLet me give you an example. There are more numbers on a dice that are bigger than or equal to 2 (2,3,4,5,6) than there are are less than 2 (1). Therefore, given a uniform distribution, the probability that a given dice roll will result in a number bigger than or equal to 2 (5/6), is higher than it resulting in 1 (1/6).\\nHowever, this doesn't mean that it's less likely to get a 1 than it is to get a 3.. or a 5.. or a 6.. all possible outcomes are just as likely as eachother.. so no, a person older than 2 doesn't have a higher chance of being selected by the wizard (even though the probability that the wizard does selects a person over two is higher).. that's of course assuming that the wizard picks someone at random\\nEdit: Thought I'd give another example. Let's say you're analyzing lottery winners in a European country whose population is 95% white. What you'd expect to see is that about 95% of the winners are white. So it wouldn't be wrong to say that a lottery winner is more likely to be white (because of the ethnic distribution), but it wouldn't be right to say that as a white person you have a higher chance of winning the lottery than if you were black. That would be a red flag if that was the case\",\n",

If a wizard was handing out rockets they would be more likely to give it to someone older than two, correct, but the probability of each person getting the rocket is still the same regardless of their age (unless the wizard has a preference to give it to someone who can fly it or something but I really can't see why :P)\",\n",

(edit: any number on the die)\\nOn the other hand the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 98%, but for any individual number above 2, let's say 20, the probability that 20 is rolled is still 1%.\\nIt's just that when you group events together, the probability that one of those events will occur greatly increases, but the probability that a specific one of them occurs stays the same.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, but you are doing it again.. \\nProbabilities only make sense in so far as they quantify uncertainty. Probabilities of events that have already occurred are always 100%.\\nConditional probabilities are probabilities of unknown events given that a past event has already occurred. \\nSo if we had a scenario where we had a wizard and the wizard already selected a candidate.. in that case the probability of the candidate being 2 years old can be written like this\\nP(A| B) \\n.. meaning the probability of A given B.. in this case:\\nA = the astronaut is 2 years old\\nB = the astronaut was selected by the wizard\\nHowever, if we already know the age of the astronaut, P(A| B) isnt going to give us any new information. Instead we\\'re looking at the probability of a 2 year old being selected by the wizard..\\nWhich is P( B | A)\\nThere is no statistical relationship between P( A | B) and P ( B | A)\\nTherefore you cannot deduce one from the other, they\\'re independent events.\\nAlthough I\\'d wager that a 2 year old is probably more likely to be selected given that wizards probably fit into the demographic of \"old white man recluse with loads of facial hair and claims to have supernatural abilities\" who I think tend to have a soft spot for the younger members of our species',\n",

Probably would be too confusing if you enter the other body and don't get any of its memories.\\nStill, if you get all the memories at once on entry into your other body, do you retain what you learned in that body? What if something happened in one body to alter its personality? Or your personalities diverged slowly over time? Seems like an identity crisis is pretty much guaranteed to happen eventually.\\nSo what if you decide to stay in one body or the other, because you like it more? Is the autopilot a conscious being? If so, I would say it's an alternate version of you that went down that other path. I'm assuming it doesn't have the ability to switch lives like you do, otherwise there would be a constant back-and-forth.
